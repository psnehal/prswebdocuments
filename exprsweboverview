 Integrating published and freely available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics from multiple sources (published GWAS, the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, or UKB-based GWAS), we created an online repository for polygenic risk scores (PRS) for common cancer traits. Our framework condenses these summary statistics into PRS using linkage disequilibrium pruning and p-value thresholding (fixed or data-adaptively optimized thresholds) or penalized, genome-wide effect size weighting. We evaluate them in the cancer-enriched cohort of the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and in the population-based UK Biobank Study (UKB). For each PRS construct, measures on performance, calibration, and discrimination are provided. Beyond the cancer PRS evaluation in MGI and UKB, the PRSweb platform features construct downloads, risk evaluation in the top percentiles, and phenome-wide PRS association studies (PRS-PheWAS) for a subset of PRS that are predictive for the primary cancer. <br/>
